//Structure of C Program, think paragraph in a paper
#include <stdio.h>//Header, what do i need to recall(in this case an I/o Library)
int main(void)//Main Body
{//Just a seperator telling the body to run below
    printf("Hello World");//Statement, PRINT THIS!, then the CPU says print what? So you include Hello World
    return 0;  //Gotta tell the CPU to stop, otherwise it wont, its like a baby, thus treat with care
}
