###Notice - 

##Number of Nested Loops and Their Iteration Logic:
- Most patterns use two nested for loops (one for rows, one for columns).

- The start and end conditions of these loops (i, j, k relative to rows) are varied to control the number of stars or spaces printed in each row. For example, j <= i for a right-angle triangle vs. j <= rows - i for an inverted one.

- Some patterns (e.g., Mirrored Right-Angle Triangle, Pyramid) use three nested loops or a combination of loops to handle spaces before printing stars.

##Space Printing Logic:

- Leading Spaces: Many patterns (e.g., Mirrored Right-Angle Triangle, Pyramid,Inverted Pyramid) introduce a separate inner loop or modify the column loop to print leading spaces (printf(" ");) before the stars, shifting the pattern horizontally.

- Internal Spaces: For hollow patterns (e.g., Hollow Square, Hollow Rhombus, Pyramid Star Pattern 15, Inverted Star Pyramid 16), spaces are printed instead of stars based on conditional logic within the innermost loop.

##Conditional Printing (`if/else`) within the Innermost Loop:

- This is crucial for hollow patterns (e.g., 15, 16, 17, 18, 20) and patterns with specific outlines (e.g., X Star Pattern 12, V Star Pattern 14).

- An if statement checks conditions (e.g., i == 1 || i == rows || j == 1 || j == m for borders, or j == 1 || j == (2 * i - 1) for diagonals) to decide whether to print a * or a space ( ).

##Relationship between `rows` and Printed Elements:

- The formulas used to determine the number of stars or spaces often involve rows, i (current row), and j (current column). Examples include 2 * i - 1 for the number of stars in a pyramid row, or rows - i for spaces.
